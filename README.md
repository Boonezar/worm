# worm

This was the midterm for CS 5410 Game Development Class. We were tasked to recreate a worm game within 4 hours of the midterm assignment details being opened. We were allowed to prepare by having enough code for the menu. It was a fun midterm to do. I didn't have enough time during the midterm to add the worm's face and make it look good, but it was added soon after.
